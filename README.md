Problem Statement : Pneumonia classificaiton using Chest X-rays using deep neural networks //
This research is focused on using a conventional simple convolutional neural network (CNN) with Hybrid Loss to create a processing model efficiently. The proposed model assists clinicians in identifying lesions on chest X-rays for accurate pneumonia diagnosis. This research showed that by incorporating the Hybrid Loss better results were obtained.
